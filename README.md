# Books-service-angular

This project is an example of CRUD application with persistent data storage and some additional 
functionality. Project was generated by Angular CLI version 6.1.4, updated to version 7.0.2. Application is hosted on Firebase server, you can access it
by clicking here: https://books-service-angular.firebaseapp.com/books

# General description

Application allows to browse through the database of books, split into categories. It has log in/register
functionality for better functionality. Unregistered users can browse through the database via explore
section or by clicking on specific category, search for positions, look at single book pages for more 
detailed book data.

When user sign in, new features are available:
 -  add new book to the system,
 -  manage user books added to the system (modify/delete),
 -  add books to the reading list, manage the list, put book on already read list.
 
 System indicates to the signed user, when the book displayed on the screen is on his reading list (with small
 blue icon on top-right corner of the book).
 

# Purpose and technology

## Angular6, Angular-CLI

I wanted to create application which allows me to develop my Angular skills. This application allows to use
many angular features, some of the ones used are:
- angular directives, pipes
- template driven forms (used in log in/ register section),
- reactive forms (dynamically generated forms with formArray, used in add book page),
- routing (for general site navigation),
- authGuard (for protecting unregistered users from visiting URLs not accessible for them),
- usage of services combined with RxJS (for better data accessibility and storage of business logic,
 RxJS observables allowed for easy data access for other components and quick reaction on changes),
- angularFire library (for easy firebase database and authentication access).

Angular-CLI was used to create new project and to create important parts of the application, like components,
services etc. It was also used to develop application locally and to generate production build (ahead of time).

## Google Firebase

Usage of google firebase allowed me to have backend part of the application.

I used realtime database storage to store information about books, and users reading lists in JSON format.

Firebase authentication was used for log in/register functionality.

Firebase hosting is used to store production build of the application, which is available for everyone. 

## CSS and animations

As default CSS provides nice look of the developed application. I used extensively css animations to make site
more reactive, when user moves cursor over the page and clicks on buttons, explores other site sections. 

## RWD

Site is  fully responsive - from the largest screens to the narrowest displays of the phones. Site is built 
on bease of few breakpoints which change the way content is displayed:
* For the largest screens menu with book categories is displayed all the time on the left, main container width is set in percetange, 
not in static value
* When display is to narrow to show menu all the time, 'hamburger' menu button is shown to display
it.
* header contains 3 breakpoints to always display data correctly, footer has 2.
* different site sections have some breakpoints if necessary. I used flex box extensively
and it's configured in a way to maintain site responsiveness. Few examples are shown below.

# Angular 7 update

As angular version 7 released in the middle of site production - project has been migrated to the newest version. 
Everything is working properly - soon i'll try to add some new functions which were added in
angular 7.
